Computational Physics Assignment #1

Problem #1 - Converting from decimal to binary representation
 The problem asks the user to input an integer and output the binary representation
 
Problem #2 - Altitude of a Satellite
 This problem asks the user to input the orbital period of a satellite (in seconds), and outputs the altitude of the satellite (in meters)
 The answers to the problem are as follows:
  Altitude of geosynchronous orbit: 35,855,910 meters. 
  Altitude of 90-minute orbit: 279,322 meters. 
  Altitude of 45-minute orbit: -2,181,560 meters. 
  This tells us that a 45-minute orbit is not possible, since the resulting orbit would be approximately 4189 kilometers below the surface of the earth. 
  
  A geosynchronous orbit is actually 23.93 hours, a persidereal day, this is because one day on earth is not actually 24 hours, but the earth rotates once on its axis every 23.93 hours. 
  The difference in altitude between a persidereal day orbit and a 24 hour orbit is 82,148 meters
